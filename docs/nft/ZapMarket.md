# ZapMarket
Provides logic for all Media contracts and hosts transactions between an ERC-721 owner and bidders. Each Media contract is configured to the Market after deployment and the Market keeps track of data that represents creation, auctioning, and bidding. This contract will enable the Media owner to utilize state changingÂ  and view functions that are defined inside the Market.

## Methods
### acceptBid nonpayable (address,uint256,tuple)
Accepts a bid from a particular bidder. Can only be called by the media contract. See {_finalizeNFTTransfer} Provided bid must match a bid in storage. This is to prevent a race condition where a bid may change while the acceptBid call is in transit. A bid cannot be accepted if it cannot be split equally into its shareholders. This should only revert in rare instances (for example, a low bid with a zero-decimal token), but is necessary to ensure fairness to all shareholders.
| Arguments | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| mediaContractAddress (address) | The media contract address.|
| tokenId (uint256) | The numerical token identifier.|
| expectedBid (tuple) | Returns the bid properties accepted by the owner ``` amount, currency, bidder, recipient, spender, sellOnShare```.|

| bidder (address) | Address of the bidder.|

### bidSharesForToken view (address,uint256)
Gets the bidShares set by the owner during the mint process and returns the ```owner, creator, collabShares```.

| tokenId (uint256) | The numerical token identifier.|

### configure nonpayable (address,address,bytes32,bytes32)

| Arguments | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| deployer (address) | Address of the collection owner deploying the media contract .|
| mediaContract (address) | Address of the deployed media contract .|
| name (bytes32) | Collection name as a bytes32 string.|

### getOwner view ()
Gets the current owner address of the market contract.

### initializeMarket nonpayable (address)
An upgradeable function that acts as the constructor. Enables contract functionality after deployment and can only be called once after the initial initialization by the owner. Inside this function body a private variable is set to true to ensure this function can not be called twice, The msg.sender is set as the owner, The platform address value is set as the platformAddress variable.
| Arguments | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| _platformAddress(address) | Address of the Vault contract.|

### isConfigured view (address)
A mapping from media address to the market configuration status. The media configuration status is set in the body of the configure function during the deployment process. This function will return true or false depending on if the media contract passed in is configured or not.
| Arguments | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| mediaContractAddress (address) | Address of the media contract .|

### isValidBid view (address,uint256,uint256)
Validates that the bid is valid by ensuring that the bid amount can be split perfectly into all the bid shares. We do this by comparing the sum of the individual share values with the amount and ensuring they are equal. Because the splitShare function uses integer division, any inconsistencies with the original and split sums would be due to a bid splitting that does not perfectly divide the bid amount.
